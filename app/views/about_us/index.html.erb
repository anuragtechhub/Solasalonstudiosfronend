      <h1>About the Founders</h1>
      <h4 class="paragraph">Matt Briger and Stratton Smith are true entrepreneurs. In the early 1990s, Stratton was a successful salon owner in St. Louis, MO. In 1995, he sold his six salons and joined Matt to start and run a real estate company in Colorado. But Stratton's passion for the beauty industry never left him, and in 2004 Stratton and Matt left the corporate world to start Sola Salon Studios. They had a simple idea and a clear vision: to put the salon professional first and always do whatâ€™s in their best interest. 11 years later, they continue to prove that they do just that.</h4>
      <h4 class="paragraph">&quot;The goal is for every stylist to live their best life, and that's something different for everybody. At the end of the day, the stylists are the ones who win.&quot; - Matt Briger</h4>
