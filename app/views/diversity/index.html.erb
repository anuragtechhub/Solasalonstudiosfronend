<h4 class="paragraph">At our core, we seek to inspire and celebrate the human spirit â€“ we feel that 

every individual brings a unique experience and perspective to our abundant 

community. Since our inception in 2004, we have supported and nurtured 

relationships within our diverse community of salon professionals. Our 

community is comprised of people who are diverse in gender, race, ethnicity, 

sexual orientation, religion and age, as well as cultural backgrounds, experiences 

and ideas.</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph">Embracing a diverse community drives a positive and inclusive environment at 

each and every Sola Salon Studios location. It is this diversity that creates, in 

large part, our culture of empowerment and success.</h4>
