              Kim Bennett Horvath&apos;s passion as a hairdresser has taken her on a journey through the beauty industry for 25 years. As a licensed cosmetologist since the age of 18, she has continued to catapult her career and her business from her humble small town beginnings, and is dedicated to inspiring others in the beauty industry.
              <br><br>
              As a Senior National Educator for Paul Mitchell for the past 23 years she was one of the first Artistic Color Coordinators chosen to help launch Paul Mitchell&apos;s first color line, as well as being a Task Force Leader where she trained and coached regional Paul Mitchell National Educators. She received the Paul Mitchell Focus Award in 2012, and continues to educate and help salons grow their business.
              <br><br>
              While working in all aspects of traditional salons, Kim made the decision of salon ownership after meeting Sola&apos;s co-founders, Matt and Stratton, at a coffee shop in Denver, Colorado. Kim quickly became the first Sola Professional in early 2004! Throughout her 11+ years at Sola, Kim has supported and represented Sola Salon Studios in myriad ways and in early 2014 became Sola&apos;s Director of Education. Within this role, Kim uses her expertise to share the Sola Salon Studios culture to connect and build relationships throughout the Professional Beauty Industry. 
              <br><br>
              Her passion and success as a Sola Professional has spread like wildfire being asked to speak with industry leaders on better business practices and has been featured in many publications including Modern Salon, Behind the Chair, and Milady Pro. She was also recently recognized as a Role Model by American Salon. Kim is dedicated to creating education opportunities for Sola Professionals to inspire them to become successful business owners while also enjoying their best artistic self.

              A large part of expert stylist Steven Lightfoot's success in the industry is the direct result of his innate ability to connect with people on an emotional level. Lightfoot is a traveling powerhouse for many leading hair companies around the world, and currently teaches at a wide array of national hair shows, which allows him to highlight his ability to bring back beauty, luster, and style to any client's hair. "Steven is a very hard worker, a very talented guy. He is very creative," states Prive owner Laurent D'ufourg. "He is eager to train, to teach, and to share his knowledge. He's very on top of what's going on in the industry, and is always looking for new products, new ingredients, and new techniques."
              <br><br>
              Lightfoot's precision and fashion forward performance can be directly attributed to the tools that he chooses for his work. "I've used many different shears, but I come back to Hanzo every time for their superior product, and the superior support that I get from the company," states Lightfoot. "If I could cut with one set of shears for every haircut it would be with my HH-8. They are the perfect balance of elegance and versatility."

              Identifiable under the self-coined alias, &quot;Popular Nobody&quot; (which also stands as the trademarked name for his line of apparel and accessories) John Mosley also happens to be one of the most sought after barbers in the industry, (amongst the other cards he helms in his &quot;renaissance man&quot; deck of talent.) With 14 years of passion and experience, John&apos;s career has been on a steady incline of watching his dreams unfold since the days of his alma mater at John Wesley Barber College in Long Beach California. Hard work, insatiable drive, and an unstoppable tenacity for his craft, have enabled John to not only keep his chair in a constant rotation of devoted clientele, but his zest for what&apos;s new and next continues to keep his technical skills a cut above the rest. Eminem and Rihanna&apos;s acclaimed &quot;Monster Tour&quot;, Music Midtown and Austin City Limits can all add John&apos;s individualized aesthetics to their on-stage resumes. As can actor Larenz Tate, Idrs Elba, and one of the most talked about names in the music industry today, Kendrick Lamar. 
              <br><br>
              No stranger to the athletic world, John also works with the NFLPA and the Washington Nationals baseball team. In addition to movies, television and commercials, his body of visual precision has also been published in ESPN the Magazine, British GQ as well as Vogue,the cover of Billboard Magazine, Black Enterprise Magazine, Ebony , and Rolling Stone. Traveling around the country and being able to share his expert techniques with both students and professionals, (along with participating in Paul Mitchell Schools&apos; Men&apos;s Cutting DVD) stand as just some of the examples of John&apos;s warm and genuine personality being further fulfilled by giving back. Not only to his profession, but his community as well. Be it speaking at high schools in his city, or coaching Pop Warner football for youth, many are able to consider John an inspiration and a life long mentor.
