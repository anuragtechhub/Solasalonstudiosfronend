As a licensed cosmetologist since the age of 18, she has continued to catapult her career and her business from her humble small town beginnings, and is dedicated to inspiring others in the beauty industry.
              <br><br>
              As a Senior National Educator for Paul Mitchell for the past 23 years she was one of the first Artistic Color Coordinators chosen to help launch Paul Mitchell's first color line, as well as being a Task Force Leader where she trained and coached regional Paul Mitchell National Educators.

            <div class="text">
              DJ joined Vidal Sassoon as a cosmetology student in 1994. Little did he know what an impact this would have on his journey. There he joined the ranks of what is now known as a legendary group of haircutting, coloring and styling educators and industry leaders. 
              <br><br>
              After a few short years DJ had become one of Vidal Sassoon's most sought after educators, â€˜teacher of the year' in his first year of teaching, and established himself as a member of the Creative Team under the guidance of Tim Hartley. Here he developed his skill as an educator working side by side with his mentors and peers Traci Sakosits, Gerard Scarpaci, Wayne Woodruff, Stephen Moody, Julian Perlingiero, Lucie Doughty amongst many others who helped lay the foundation of what would become the Vidal Sassoon ABC system.
              <br><br>
              By 2002 DJ transitioned onto the next phase of his career by joining the Paul Mitchell organization to create Paul Mitchell the School's haircutting system and curriculum. While at Paul Mitchell he became a global platform artist sharing his knowledge and skill to a worldwide audience. This gave DJ the ability in the mid 2000's to start creating on other levels such as video production and â€˜step by step' education, earning DJ the much coveted Hairbrained Video Award in 2014.
              <br><br>
              In 2011 DJ started theFactory, an independent creative production space, academy and salon based in San Diego, which gives DJ the ability to educate on many different levels such as hands-on education and web based education. 
              <br><br>
              DJ is one the worlds most sought after teachers in the industry because of his no fluff approach and his ability to breakdown the what, why, how, and when in haircutting. He believes that â€˜Knowledge Destroys Fear' and he is proud to represent the hairdresser as an independent artist.

            <div class="text">
              Sam Villa is known for doing things differently to challenge, inspire and motivate change. His encouragement to stylists is unrivaled, as he genuinely wants each one of them to reach deep to identify how they can make a change to promote their own growth. His talents stretch far beyond his brilliant cutting and finishing skills; he has a plethora of business skills that enliven stylists to think about how they speak to their guests to add value behind the chair.
              <br><br>
              &quot;Sharing is the greatest gift we can give one anotherâ€¦to help each other grow and prosper, we all need to pay it forward,&quot; says Sam.  Consistent research, along with a respect for the fundamentals, Sam is always on the move for new and unconventional ways of cutting and finishing hair - like using a flat iron for versatility, texturizing iron to create hidden volume and using disconnection to create styles that look blended and can be worn in multiple ways. He is a true messenger sharing his knowledge with stylists in hopes that they too will share with others to enrich the industry...upgrade the industry by respecting and supporting one another - #ArtistsSupportingArtists.   
              <br><br>
              Sam is in his glory and most comfortable when teaching â€“ a natural transition from his early coaching days in sports.  Practice, practice, practice, until you master the craft and then share with others, so they too can become successful!  Whether facilitating an in-salon class or on a stage at a major event, there is always something to be discovered and learned. &quot;Stylists need a good understanding of the fundamentals of basic techniques, once mastered, they can be manipulated to create modern silhouettes and textures,&quot; explains Sam.
              <br><br>
              &quot;It's time to SHOUT IT OUT! The way for us to BE better is to COME TOGETHER as an industry, and the SHOUT begins here with Sam Villa and Redken!&quot; adds Sam.
