      <p>Located on 2nd avenue in downtown Nashville in &quot;the District,&quot; BB King's Blues Club is just blocks away from all of the city's hot spots! It is four blocks away from our preferred hotel, the Fairlane, and about 20 minutes from Nashville International Airport.</p>
      <p>The closest parking lot is right across from BB King's Blues Club in Commerce Street Garage with a daily rate of $20/day. The Metro Courthouse Garage is about a 10-minute walk and $15/day. If you prefer not to pay for parking, we suggest utilizing ride share options or walking from the hotel, since parking in downtown Nashville can get very crowded.</p>
