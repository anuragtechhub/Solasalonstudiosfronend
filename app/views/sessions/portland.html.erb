Whether teaching face-to-face in small hands on classes, on main stage, or reaching his millions of social media followers, Sam changes people. He is a true leader that brings out the best in others. As the 2017 NAHA Lifetime Achievement Award Winner he is known for doing things differently to challenge, inspire and motivate change. His encouragement to stylists is unrivaled, as he genuinely wants each one of them to reach deep to identify how they can make a change to promote their own growth. Sam’s talents stretch far beyond his brilliant cutting and finishing skills; he has a plethora of business skills that enliven stylists to think about how they speak to their guests to add value behind the chair. 
        <br /><br />
        “Sharing is the greatest gift we can give one another...to help each other grow and prosper, we all need to pay it forward,” says Sam. Consistent research  along with a respect for the fundamentals, Sam is always on the move for new and unconventional ways of cutting and finishing hair - like using a flat iron for versatility, texturizing iron to create hidden volume and using disconnection to create styles that look blended and can be worn in multiple ways. He is a true messenger sharing his knowledge with stylists in hopes that they too will share with others to enrich the industry...upgrade the industry by respecting and supporting one another - #SamVillaCommunity.

Whether facilitating an in-salon class or on a stage at a major event, there is always something to be discovered and learned. Stylists need a good understanding of the fundamentals of basic techniques, once mastered, they can be manipulated to create modern silhouettes and textures,” explains Sam.

      <div class="text">
        Kelly Cardenas is a beauty industry icon, author, international educator for John Paul Mitchell Systems, Business Coach, Salon Owner, husband and father. He attributes the success of his namesake salons, located in Las Vegas, Chicago and Carlsbad, CA and to the team around him. Cardenas’ concept of integrity-based success has conditioned his team of trend-setting stylists to reach exponential heights as salon operators as well as individual beauty professionals.  
        <br /><br />
        Cardenas’ upbringing is where he draws the majority of his inspiration. Having two amazing parents who taught him discipline, hard work, humility, and most importantly that anything was possible as long as you are willing to put in the work, prepared him for the uncertainty of business and life.  
        <br /><br />
        Kelly Cardenas Salon has a culture of hairdressers that deliver five-star service without the ego and supports the mission that everyone who experiences their environment should be treated like an A-list celebrity. The salon has become the industry standard for service, consistency and up-to-the-minute technique. 
        <br /><br />
          Public speaking has been a personal passion for Kelly Cardenas for the past 26 years. He started as a student taking every class he could find involving public speaking; as long as he could take something away from the experience, he knew it was worthwhile. Kelly’s excitement for public speaking comes from the light bulb he sees turn on in people after hearing his encouraging words - words that have the power to change a life. Kelly has had speaking appearances in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York, Berlin, Shanghai and many more, locally, as well as worldwide.  
        <br /><br />
        Kelly refers to his relationships as his most valuable currency and has set out to leave any environment he’s in better than the way he found it. Wanting to give back to the communities that have given him so much, Cardenas and his team are involved with multiple organizations including Aid for AIDS of Nevada, American Cancer Society Relay for Life, beauty industry favorite Eyes on Cancer, Showers of Blessings haircuts for homeless, Las Vegas Rescue Mission and Las Vegas Boys and Girls Clubs...among others.
        <br /><br />
        Recently, Cardenas wrote his first book “The 6 Indicators for Business and Life,” serving as a roadmap to guide individuals through the necessary tools to evaluate and measure the character and integrity needed to drive the bottom line in business and excel in personal relationships. The book represents the foundation for how Kelly operates in both his personal and business arenas and is well received by all who read it.  
        <br /><br />
        Although his journey started in the professional beauty industry, Cardenas feels that it is simply his conduit to have the opportunity to invest in the most valuable commodity that has ever been...people!!!  
        <br /><br />
        When he’s not running his salons, Kelly enjoys spending time with his wife Brooklyn, kids Makena and Maddox, and the family dog Skyler in Carlsbad, CA.

        <br><br>
        Michael's breakthrough book, &quot;A Little Off the Top&quot; was the first in a series of DVD videos, CD audios, tracking journals, and organizational tools that have since helped over a million salon professionals break through to a more prosperous and purposeful career.
