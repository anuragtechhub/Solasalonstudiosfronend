"Andrew is an accomplished artist and educator, his devotion to teaching is evident as his goal is for stylists to 'get it' â€¦ his content directly relates to and is immediately applicable to stylists working behind the chair everydayâ€¦he is a natural!" â€“ says Sam Villa, Founding Partner of the Sam Villa Brand
<br /><br />
Andrew Carruthers' diverse career has been built on a foundation of consistent clientele behind the chair, yet many other focuses feed his soul. In the past, Carruthers has worked as an educator for companies such as TIGI and Paul Mitchell Advanced Education. From small one-on-one classes to large stages, his love for supporting others and sharing discoveries has been a primary passion since early on. "When I teach, I have one goal in mind â€“ to hand off information that is useable immediately, regardless of where stylists are located and whether they are an elite hairdresser, a recent beauty school graduate or someone who does hair in a rural area," explains Carruthers. 
<br /><br />
Andrew's award winning photo work shows his regard to explore his artistry and inspire outside of the salon, stage, and classroom.  As a master stylist and mentor at the NAHA recognized Lunatic Fringe Salon (Salt Lake City, UT), Andrew continues to work behind the chair and shape new hairdressers everyday.  "My passion is artistry and education, so Sam and I have similar philosophies on teaching, I thinks it's a perfect fit."

        Sam Villa is changing the industry, one hairdresser at a time. Whether teaching face-to-face in small hands on classes, on main stage, or reaching his millions of social media followers, Sam changes people. He is a true leader that brings out the best in others. As the 2017 NAHA Lifetime Achievement Award Winner he is known for doing things differently to challenge, inspire and motivate change. His encouragement to stylists is unrivaled, as he genuinely wants each one of them to reach deep to identify how they can make a change to promote their own growth. Sam's talents stretch far beyond his brilliant cutting and finishing skills; he has a plethora of business skills that enliven stylists to think about how they speak to their guests to add value behind the chair. 
        <br /><br />
        &quot;Sharing is the greatest gift we can give one another...to help each other grow and prosper, we all need to pay it forward,&quot; says Sam. Consistent research  along with a respect for the fundamentals, Sam is always on the move for new and unconventional ways of cutting and finishing hair - like using a flat iron for versatility, texturizing iron to create hidden volume and using disconnection to create styles that look blended and can be worn in multiple ways. He is a true messenger sharing his knowledge with stylists in hopes that they too will share with others to enrich the industry...upgrade the industry by respecting and supporting one another - #SamVillaCommunity. An act for which he was named the 2020 International Hair Influencer of the Year at the International Hairdressing Awards.
        <br /><br />
        Sam is in his glory and most comfortable when teaching â€“ a natural transition from his early coaching days in sports. Practice, practice, practice, until you master the craft and then share with others, so they too can become successful! Whether facilitating an in-salon class or on a stage at a major event, there is always something to be discovered and learned. Stylists need a good understanding of the fundamentals of basic techniques, once mastered, they can be manipulated to create modern silhouettes and textures,&quot; explains Sam.
        <br /><br />
        It's time to SHOUT IT OUT! The way for us to BE better is to COME TOGETHER as an industry, and the SHOUT begins here with Sam Villa and Redken!&quot; adds Sam.

        Kelly Cardenas is a beauty industry icon, author, international educator for John Paul Mitchell Systems, Business Coach, Salon Owner, husband and father. He attributes the success of his namesake salons, located in Las Vegas, Chicago and Carlsbad, CA and to the team around him. Cardenas' concept of integrity-based success has conditioned his team of trend-setting stylists to reach exponential heights as salon operators as well as individual beauty professionals.â€¨â€¨
        <br /><br />
        Cardenas' upbringing is where he draws the majority of his inspiration. Having two amazing parents who taught him discipline, hard work, humility, and most importantly that anything was possible as long as you are willing to put in the work, prepared him for the uncertainty of business and life.â€¨â€¨
        <br /><br />
        Kelly Cardenas Salon has a culture of hairdressers that deliver five-star service without the ego and supports the mission that everyone who experiences their environment should be treated like an A-list celebrity. The salon has become the industry standard for service, consistency and up-to-the-minute technique.Â 
        <br /><br />
        â€¨â€¨Public speaking has been a personal passion for Kelly Cardenas for the past 26 years. He started as a student taking every class he could find involving public speaking; as long as he could take something away from the experience, he knew it was worthwhile. Kelly's excitement for public speaking comes from the light bulb he sees turn on in people after hearing his encouraging words - words that have the power to change a life. Kelly has had speaking appearances in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York, Berlin, Shanghai and many more, locally, as well as worldwide.â€¨â€¨
        <br /><br />
        Kelly refers to his relationships as his most valuable currency and has set out to leave any environment he's in better than the way he found it. Wanting to give back to the communities that have given him so much, Cardenas and his team are involved with multiple organizations including Aid for AIDS of Nevada, American Cancer Society Relay for Life, beauty industry favorite Eyes on Cancer, Showers of Blessings haircuts for homeless, Las Vegas Rescue Mission and Las Vegas Boys and Girls Clubs...among others.
        <br /><br />
        Recently, Cardenas wrote his first book &quot;The 6 Indicators for Business and Life,&quot; serving as a roadmap to guide individuals through the necessary tools to evaluate and measure the character and integrity needed to drive the bottom line in business and excel in personal relationships. The book represents the foundation for how Kelly operates in both his personal and business arenas and is well received by all who read it.â€¨â€¨
        <br /><br />
        Although his journey started in the professional beauty industry, Cardenas feels that it is simply his conduit to have the opportunity to invest in the most valuable commodity that has ever been...people!!!â€¨â€¨
        <br /><br />
        When he's not running his salons, Kelly enjoys spending time with his wife Brooklyn, kids Makena and Maddox, and the family dog Skyler in Carlsbad, CA.

        What makes Mannah such an incredible educator

        and mentor beyond his laudable talent? â€“ he's
        also someone young up-and-comers can relate to
        and connect with. Having twice taking the title of
        "Newcomer of the Year" (1999 and again in 2000)
        â€“ walking the path many of them are embarking
        on, he's been where many of his students and
        mentees are now. Right at the beginning of their
        burgeoning careers, learning and growing and
        ready for more!  
        <br /><br />
        In August 2018 Joico announced Mannah as Joico Guest Artistic Director a crowning
        achievement, not simply to lead a brand's global education but to find a brand who's value's, an
        artist can mesh so well with, and represent with pleasure and pride, "...I absolutely love
        working with [Joico] and what the brand stands for. It's the healthy hair company which
        believes in education, innovation, team-building, creativity and global growth. All these
        things are close to my heart...," Mannah shares.  
        <br /><br />    
        Mannah's relationship with Joico started in 2017, working on a photo-shoot in Australia, as well
        as video shoots and events in the U.S. which launched Beach Shake and Body Shake dry-
        styling texturizing sprays (follow-ups to the wildly successful Hair Shake Liquid-to-Powder
        Texturizer). He was also a headliner for the brand at their Joico Global Destination Education
        week-long education get-away in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, where audiences raved
        about his stage presentation. Guests were treated to his blend of artistry and passion delievered
        in only the way Mannah can â€“ with his personal touch and modern flair.
