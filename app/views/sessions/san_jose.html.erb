          &quot;Andrew is an accomplished artist and educator, his devotion to teaching is evident as his goal is for stylists to ‘get it&apos; … his content directly relates to and is immediately applicable to stylists working behind the chair everyday...he is a natural!&quot; – says Sam Villa, Founding Partner of the Sam Villa Brand
          <br><br>
          Andrew Carruthers&apos; diverse career has been built on a foundation of consistent clientele behind the chair, yet many other focuses feed his soul. In the past, Carruthers has worked as an educator for companies such as TIGI and Paul Mitchell Advanced Education. From small one-on-one classes to large stages, his love for supporting others and sharing discoveries has been a primary passion since early on. &quot;When I teach, I have one goal in mind – to hand off information that is useable immediately, regardless of where stylists are located and whether they are an elite hairdresser, a recent beauty school graduate or someone who does hair in a rural area,&quot; explains Carruthers. 
          <br><br>
          Andrew&apos;s award winning photo work shows his regard to explore his artistry and inspire outside of the salon, stage, and classroom.  As a master stylist and mentor at the NAHA recognized Lunatic Fringe Salon (Salt Lake City, UT), Andrew continues to work behind the chair and shape new hairdressers everyday.  &quot;My passion is artistry and education, so Sam and I have similar philosophies on teaching, I thinks it&apos;s a perfect fit.&quot;
