              Sam Villa is known for doing things differently to challenge, inspire and motivate change. His encouragement to stylists is unrivaled, as he genuinely wants each one of them to reach deep to identify how they can make a change to promote their own growth. Sam&apos;s talents stretch far beyond his brilliant cutting and finishing skills; he has a plethora of business skills that enliven stylists to think about how they speak to their guests to add value behind the chair.

              &quot;Sharing is the greatest gift we can give one another...to help each other grow and prosper, we all need to pay it forward,&quot;  says Sam.Consistent research, along with a respect for the fundamentals, Sam is always on the move for new and unconventional ways of cutting and finishing hair - like using a flat iron for versatility, texturizing iron to create hidden volume and using disconnection to create styles that look blended and can be worn in multiple ways. He is a true messenger sharing his knowledge with stylists in hopes that they too will share with others to enrich the industry...upgrade the industry by respecting and supporting one another - #ArtistsSupportingArtists.   
              <br /><br />Sam is in his glory and most comfortable when teaching â€“ a natural transition from his early coaching days in sports.  Practice, practice, practice, until you master the craft and then share with others, so they too can become successful!Whether facilitating an in-salon class or on a stage at a major event, there is always something to be discovered and learned. &quot;Stylists need a good understanding of the fundamentals of basic techniques, once mastered, they can be manipulated to create modern silhouettes and textures,&quot;  explains Sam. &quot;It&apos;s time to SHOUT IT OUT! The way for us to BE better is to COME TOGETHER as an industry, and the SHOUT begins here with Sam Villa and Redken!&quot;  adds Sam.
