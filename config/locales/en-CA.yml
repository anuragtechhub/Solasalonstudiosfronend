      heading2: About the Founders
      body3: "Matt Briger and Stratton Smith are true entrepreneurs. In the early 1990s, Stratton was a successful salon owner in St. Louis, MO. In 1995, he sold his six salons and joined Matt to start and run a real estate company in Colorado. But Stratton's passion for the beauty industry never left him, and, in 2004 Stratton and Matt left the corporate world to start Sola Salon Studios. They had a single idea and a clear vision: to put the salon professional first. Twelve years later, they continue to prove that they do just that."
      quote: "The goal is for every stylist to live their best life, and that's something different for everybody. At the end of the day, the stylists are the ones who win."

I am opening my books to female clients for the first time so I have been diving into the tutorials on women's haircutting for a refresher. There are also several motivational and business building videos that I could watch a hundred times! They range from quick 1 minute videos which are great for in-between clients and full one hour step-by-step tutorials. There really is something there for everyone!"

          testimonial_text: "My daughter and I (we are a mother/daughter duo salon) attended the very first Sola Session in Denver. We loved getting to meet, greet and have one on one with the educators before or after their show. We loved the smaller, family like setting. And, the fact that everyone there was a Sola owner was even more fabulous."
