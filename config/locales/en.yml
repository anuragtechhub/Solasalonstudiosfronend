      heading2: About the Founders
      body3: "Matt Briger and Stratton Smith are true entrepreneurs. In the early 1990s, Stratton was a successful salon owner in St. Louis, MO. In 1995, he sold his six salons and joined Matt to start and run a real estate company in Colorado. But Stratton's passion for the beauty industry never left him, and in 2004 Stratton and Matt left the corporate world to start Sola Salon Studios. They had a simple idea and a clear vision: to put the salon professional first. 11 years later, they continue to prove that they do just that."
      quote: "The goal is for every stylist to live their best life, and that's something different for everybody. At the end of the day, the stylists are the ones who win."

      meta_description: "Why go independent? Why Sola? All your questions about owning your own salon suite at Sola answered."
      frequently_asked_questions: Frequently Asked Questions
      question1: Why Sola?
      answer1: |
        <p>At Sola Salon Studios<sup>&#174;</sup>, we lease individual studios where you can operate your own boutique salon. Salon owners at Sola customize their own studio, set their own schedule and prices, and enjoy the freedom and benefits of salon ownership without the risk associated with opening a traditional salon.</p>
        <p>If you&#8217;re looking to make the move to a salon studio, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear that at Sola, you simply get more. We invest thousands of dollars in each studio, providing the highest-quality fixtures and the ideal amount of cabinets specifically designed to accommodate salon professionals. With many other salon studios, you will be provided with only a shampoo bowl and chair. At Sola, your studio will be equipped with the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A custom build-out designed specifically for you that includes pull-out color drawers, abundant storage, soft-touch closures and retail shelving</li>
          <li>Oversize sliding glass door with lock and floor-to-ceiling walls to allow you the privacy to play the music of your choice and enjoy one-on-one conversations</li>
          <li>Individual ventilation in each studio</li>
          <li>High-end hydraulic chair and shampoo bowl</li>
          <li>Full-spectrum lighting to emulate natural light</li>
          <li>Instant and abundant hot water supply</li>
          <li>Utilities and Wi-Fi included</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition to the physical amenities, you&#8217;ll find that being at Sola will allow you to manage your own schedule, avoid salon politics and drama, and create the ideal atmosphere for you and your clients.</p>
      question2: Aside from the studio and its amenities, will Sola provide any other support to help me get my business up and running?
      answer2: |
        <p>At Sola Salon Studios<sup>&#174;</sup>, we have your back. Our detailed start-up manual provides you with all of the necessary forms, tips, and information to help get your business set up and ready to go:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start-up checklist</li>
          <li>Forms and tips to obtain your salon license and other licenses and permits</li>
          <li>Details on studio setup: insurance, equipment needed, paint and more</li>
          <li>Credit card processing tips</li>
          <li>Retail support and distributor contacts</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By joining the largest community of independent salon owners in the country, you will have access to liability insurance, disability insurance (available in certain states), discounts on retail, special offers for online scheduling, continuing education programs, industry events and more.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we host cocktail parties, family picnics and gatherings to strengthen our local Sola communities.</p>
      question3: How is working in a salon studio different than working at a traditional salon?
      answer3: <p>At Sola, you will become the business owner of your own boutique salon. You set the prices for your services and choose the retail products you want to sell, and you keep 100 percent of the profits. You&#8217;ll have a key to your studio and can work when you want, with sole access to your supplies and equipment. Why rent a chair or booth when you can have your own salon for about the same cost?</p>
      question4: Who are the studios at Sola designed for?
      answer4: <p>Our studios can be modified to accommodate hairdressers, skincare professionals, nail stylists, massage therapists, spray tanners and more. We design our studios with flexibility so that we can work with you to fit your salon needs.</p>
      question5: Can more than one salon professional work in a single Sola studio?
      answer5: <p>Yes, we have floor plans to accommodate more than one salon professional and will work with you to provide the best accommodations for your business.</p>
      question6: Can I decorate my studio?
      answer6: <p>Yes, please do! We want your studio to reflect your personality, so feel free to paint the walls, bring in your own d&#233;cor, play your own music, and create the atmosphere that is best for you and your clients.</p>
      question7: How do I know if I&#8217;m right for Sola?
      answer7: |
        <p>Are you ready to take control of your professional life? Imagine setting your own hours and prices in a studio that reflects your taste in music, color and style. This is the right opportunity for you if you have an established clientele and are ready to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be your own boss</li>
          <li>Escape the salon drama</li>
          <li>Manage your own schedule</li>
          <li>Set your own prices</li>
          <li>Sell the retail products you love</li>
          <li>Customize your own salon studio</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Join our community of nearly 10,000 like-minded salon professionals to experience a level of creative independence and career support you won&#8217;t find anywhere else.</p>
      question8: What are the hours of operation?
      answer8: <p>At Sola you have access to your studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our main doors are open during regular business hours; however, if you have a client at 8 am or on a Sunday when the main doors are locked, you can buzz your clients in via the call box. This allows you to take appointments during the hours that best fit your schedule and the schedules of your clients.</p>
      question9: What are the key advantages to renting a studio at Sola?
      answer9: |
        <ol>
          <li>You set your own schedule, with 24/7 access to your studio</li>
          <li>You set your own prices and keep all profits from retail sales</li>
          <li>You can personalize your studio</li>
          <li>You can play your own music and have private conversations</li>
          <li>You work in a drama-free environment</li>
        </ol>
      question10: What are the next steps to getting started at Sola?
      answer10: <p>To reserve your studio, contact us via our Contact Us form, or give us a call! We would love to set up a confidential tour of our studios to determine which setup is best for you. After getting the appropriate salon license, most of our stylists move in and start working right away! All you need to do is bring your back bar, towels, personal equipment and any decorations you like, and you&#8217;re ready to open for business.</p>

        <p>Randall Clark is a fire-tested executive with an astute business acumen and unshakeable belief in servant leadership. Those qualities combined with his deep business development history uniquely qualifies him to lead the Sola community of sophisticated franchise owners and independent salon owners alike.</p>
        <p>Randall's strategic, systematic thinking, alongside his unwavering dedication to protecting the Sola brand and our customers' best interests, is a driving force behind Sola's demonstrated success and predicted future growth.</p>
        <p>With his 27 years as an experienced senior corporate executive and equity investment principal, Randall has led a diverse set of companies and has sponsored strategic investment partnerships and alternative asset operating platforms to sustainable growth and significant enterprise value creation. As a private equity investment sponsor, he has led and completed over $3.7 billion in investment transaction volume, comprising in excess of $850 million of equity capital commitments.</p>
        <p>After receiving his BA from the University of Arizona, Randall went on to pursue his Juris Doctorate (JD) from the Pepperdine University School of Law. He has also served as the chairman of the Rocky Mountain Chapter of the Young Presidents Association (both YPO and YPO Gold)—an international association dedicated to improving leadership through continuing peer-to-peer education and idea exchange.</p>  
        <p>Randall reports directly to the Sola Salon Studios' board of directors and co-founders Matt Briger and Stratton Smith. He is responsible for overseeing leadership, strategy and execution for all growth initiatives of the Sola Salon Studios franchise, both domestically and internationally, including operational management of all company-owned and operated Sola locations.</p>
      ben_jones_bio: |
        <p>Ben Jones propels Sola Salon Studios forward by developing innovative strategies and assessing risk for all national and international growth opportunities.

        <p>Ben earned a bachelor's degree with distinction from Duke University, followed by a Doctor of Law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. Prior to joining Sola in 2012, Ben was responsible for business development and risk management for tech giant Qwest Communications and real estate investment company Affordable Residential Communities.

In addition, he recently joined the board of directors for the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, which provides grants to those seeking to effect positive change in North Carolina and at Duke University.</p>
        <p>Ben's passion for supporting and helping the independent salon owner community thrive is a driving force behind the ongoing evolution and innovation of the Sola brand. His ability to develop large-scale strategies for growth combined with a realistic understanding of the associated risks make him uniquely situated to help Sola break new ground globally.</p>

        <p>As the first employee hired by Sola co-founders Stratton and Matt in 2005, Todd was struck by the power of Sola from the very beginning. &quot;Early on, stylists cried tears of joy when they signed up for a studio. They were excited to open their own business, and after several stylists cried out of joy (or exhaustion of where they were at), I knew this was something big.&quot;</p>
        <p>As a member of the Sola team since the opening of the first Sola location in Denver, Todd has been a part of the development of the company every step along the way. His considerable knowledge of the Sola experience and his meaningful relationships with the franchisee community are invaluable to the continued growth and success of the Sola brand.</p>
        <p>Before joining Sola, Todd spent six years as the codirector of acquisitions for Affordable Residential Communities, where he managed seven acquisition teams and completed the purchase of $1.5 billion in real estate assets. His extensive experience includes managing acquisitions for Aramark and working as a senior auditor and certified public accountant.</p>

      meta_description: ""
      founders: Founders Stratton Smith and Matt Briger
      subhead: "What started out as a simple agreement scrawled on a Starbucks napkin has grown into the largest and fastest growing salon studio business in the country."
      body1: In 2004, Sola Salon Studios co-founders Stratton Smith and Matt Briger wanted to do more than design beautiful, move-in-ready salon studios. They set out to build a thriving community.
      body2: From the beginning, Stratton and Matt made a humble commitment to serve the beauty professional and always to put their best interests first. Their vision was to give the beauty professional control over their environment, schedule, choice of retail, pricing and so much more. When they were in the early stages of developing the innovative concept of turnkey salon studios in a co-working environment, they met with Denver-based stylist Kim Bennett Horvath.
      callout1: "&quot;I was inspired by their vision of Sola. They didn't want to sell me anything or compete with my business. Everything was all my choice! So I signed up right then.&quot;"
      callout1_name: "Kim Bennett Horvath"
      body3: Impressed by Stratton and Matt's unwavering commitment to bettering the lives and businesses of independent salon owners, Kim took a leap of faith and became the very first Sola stylist in Denver, Colorado.
      body4: In 2005, the first franchised Sola location was opened, paving the way for our best-in-class franchisees and onsite operators. And in the blink of an eye, 10 years later, Sola celebrated 5,000 independent beauty professionals across the country.
      body5: Throughout the years, Sola has become more than just another salon suites rental business; we are an all-encompassing independent salon business solution. Our leadership team drives constant innovation for the on-site studio experience as well as providing cutting-edge technology and ongoing educational resources to the Sola community. 
      body6: In 2016, Sola launched Sola Pro, an exclusive app, to host industry deals, special offers and a variety of educational resources to bridge the gap between the professional beauty industry and the Sola community. Shortly after, the first Sola Sessions event kicked off in Denver, providing a unique live education experience to inspire and connect the ever-growing Sola community. With the 2017 addition of our exclusive technology SolaGenius—an all-in-one business platform launched in partnership with GlossGenius, designed to help an independent salon owner manage their schedule, customer relationship management, marketing, analytics and payment processing—we can proudly say that we support our customers along every step of their independent salon journey.
      body7: "Today, Stratton and Matt's humble commitment has blossomed into a worldwide movement. We are proud to say that Sola Salon Studios is a thriving, diverse and welcoming community of more than 10,000 independent salon professionals across 400+ locations in United States, Canada and, soon, the rest of the world. Our culture has been cultivated around one simple ideal: &quot;freedom to live the life you love.&quot;"
      callout2: "&quot;The goal is for every stylist to live their best life, and that's something different for everybody. At the end of the day, the stylists are the ones who win.&quot;"
      callout2_name: "Matt Briger"
      body8: Sola has blazed the trail for the independent stylist movement, offering new levels of creative freedom to those who are inspired to make the transition. We aim to make your transition to independence as smooth as possible. You are independent and unique at Sola, but you are not alone.
      body9: Through our business-building tools, educational offerings, encouraged networking and strong support system, Sola empowers hairdressers, estheticians, nail techs, massage therapists and other like-minded professionals to take full control of their lives and careers. With a bright future ahead, the Sola team continues to identify ways to cultivate growth through innovation, creativity, and most importantly, community.

      body: |
        <p>Privacy Policy</p>
        <p>Last revised and Effective February 1, 2017</p>
        <p>Sola Franchise Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Sola Salon Studios Canada, Inc. (&quot;Sola&quot;), the proud owner of the Sola Salon Studios&reg; brand, knows that your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy sets out our privacy practices that apply when you use any website, mobile application or other online service or platform of Sola or any other Sola company that links or refers to it (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;), regardless of who owns or operates the Services, as well as our interactions with you on third party platforms (such as social media).</p>
        
        <p>1. Information We Collect</p>

        <p>Information You Provide to Us. We collect information you give us when you use the Services. For example, when you visit one of our websites or use one of our Services, create an account with us, participate in a survey or promotion, or take advantage of our in-salon Wi-Fi service, we may ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, year of birth, gender, street address, or mobile phone number so that we can provide Services to you.

        <p>Information About Your Use of the Services. In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we may collect information about your use of the Services. For example, we may collect:</p>

        <p>Location information — such as your computer's IP address, your mobile device's GPS signal or information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use the Services.</p>
        <p>Information From Third-Party Sources. We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Services through that site.</p>

We may  this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service, products, Services, and promotions.</p>
        <p>When you Make any Purchase.  If you use a credit or debit card for your purchase, your debit or credit card-related information will be collected to process and administer your payment. When you make purchases through the online Services, we may collect information such as your name, email address, billing address, the email or mailing address for delivery (if applicable), phone number, and payment card information.

        <p>To Deliver Targeted Advertising. We may use your information, including your location information, to facilitate the delivery of targeted ads, promotions, and offers to you, on behalf of ourselves, select business partners, and advertisers, on and off the Services.

        <p>To Better Understand Our Customers and to Improve Our Services.

We do this to better understand and serve our users, and to improve our products and Services.</p>
        <p>Consent. We may otherwise use your information with your consent or at your direction.</p>
        
        <p>3. Sharing of Information</p>
        <p>The following provides information about entities with which we may share information. Our practices vary depending on the type of information and sharing.</p>
        <p>Affiliates. We may share information within our family of affiliated companies so that we may provide offers from those companies that may be relevant to you, better understand your preferences, and improve our Services.</p>
        <p>Franchisees. We may share information with franchisees.  We also may provide our franchisees with information so that they may provide you with information, offers and promotions that might interest you.</p>
        <p>Business Partners. We may also share your information with business partners to provide you with Services that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion that runs on our Services but that is offered, sponsored or co-sponsored by another company, your information may be shared with that company. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities and recommend you review their privacy policies carefully.</p>
        <p>Service Providers. We may share information with companies providing services on our behalf, such as hosting vendors, advertising service providers, data analytics companies, marketing service companies, and list managers. We also may share your information, including your payment information, as appropriate to process your payments for the Services or complete a transaction. </p>
        <p>Social Media Services. If you connect a social media account with the Services or engage with our services through a social media platform, we may share your information with that social media platform, and it may share information about you with us. We may use this information to personalize your experience on the Services and on the third-party social media platforms, or to provide you with offers or other products or Services you may request. The social media services' use of the shared information will be governed by the social media services' privacy policy and your social media account settings. </p>
        <p>Companies that Provide Content, Advertising, or Functionality. Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties, such as our advertisers. These companies may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies, and this information may be combined with information collected across different websites and online services in order to deliver ads that are more relevant to you, both on and off our Services.</p>
        <p>Other Parties When Required or Permitted by Law, or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services.We and our service providers (including affiliates) may use and share your personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents or users, to detect, suppress or prevent fraud or where otherwise required or permitted by applicable law or legal process, including responding to a search warrant or other legally valid requests from public and government authorities (which may include lawful access by U.S., Canadian, or other governmental authorities, courts or law enforcement agencies).</p>
        <p>Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.</p>
        <p>Otherwise With Your Consent or at Your Direction. In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.</p>
        <p>Aggregated Data. We also may provide aggregated information, and data with personal identifiers removed, to third parties to describe how our customers are using the Services.</p>
        
        <p>4. Online Advertising and Cookies</p>
        <p>We and other companies that provide advertising and other services on our Services may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.</p>
        <p>Interest-Based Advertisements. We may use third parties to serve advertisements on our Services and on other websites and digital platforms. These companies may use cookies, web beacons or other technologies to report certain information about your visits to our Services and other websites (such as web pages you visit and your response to ads) in order to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you, both on and off our Services. To learn more and to opt-out of having your information used by these companies for online behavioral advertising purposes, please see &quot;Choices with Respect to Interest-Based Advertisements&quot; below. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider.</p>
        <p>Cookies. &quot;Cookies&quot; are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:</p>
        <p>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service</p>
        <p>Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.</p>
        <p>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don't receive the same ad each time you access a Service.</p>
        <p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable cookies, it may interfere with the functioning of the Services.</p>
        <p>Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or &quot;pixels&quot;) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you both on and off the Service.</p>
        <p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>
        
        <p>5. Privacy and Access Choices Available To You</p>
        <p>Choices With Respect To Cookies and Similar Technologies. You may block cookies and similar technologies in your browser or device settings, as and if permitted by such device.</p>
        <p>Choices With Respect To Interest-Based Advertising. You may opt out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the  the National Advertizing Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.; The Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org" target="_blank">http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org</a>; and The Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada at <a href="http://youradchoices.ca" target="_blank">http://youradchoices.ca</a>.</p>

Subject to applicable law, you may also have a right to access, update, and correct inaccuracies in other personal information in our custody and control, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. You may request access, updating and corrections of inaccuracies in the personal information we have in our custody or control by emailing or writing to us at the contact information set out below.

        <p>6. Data Security</p>
        <p>We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect personal information in our custody and control against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our Services, nor can we guarantee that the information you provide will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>
        
        <p>7. Other Important Information</p>
        <p>Children's Privacy. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.</p>
        <p>Links to Third-Party Sites. Our Services may link to third-party websites and services that we do not operate and are outside of our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by other websites or other services. Please exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.</p>
        <p>Your California Privacy Rights. California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@solasalonstudios.com">info@solasalonstudios.com</a> with such written request. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>International Transfers. The Services are headquartered in the United States. Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to, maintained and processed in the United States or another country by us or our service providers for the purposes mentioned above in accordance with applicable law. The privacy laws of these countries may not always offer the same level of protection as in your country.
