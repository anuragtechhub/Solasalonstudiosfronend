""It is getting very close to a year since taking a leap of faith and opening a studio salon with Sola along with my business partner Melissa. I couldn't be happier with our decision! It's everything I have wanted for my business. Being able to be my own boss and have my own salon but without the high overhead of running a regular salon setup. It has been fun getting to know our neighbors and building a relationship between all of us in our new Sola community! My clients love the location too. It's easy to find, in a great location in the heart of downtown, parking is easy with the parking lot directly in the back, and it's always kept nice and clean! As a stylist who values her education, I appreciate that they are providing us with lots of classes and learning opportunities as well. If you are even the slightest bit intrigued by what Sola has to offer you, I highly recommend it."" 

-Erica Mohammadi, Muah 

""I love being a part of Sola! Not only do I get to own my own salon but you get additional help from the management team on education and marketing. Plus, you get to know all the other salon owners as well! A drama free zone with the opportunity to help each other out if needed. My clients love the coziness and the fact they get my full attention. Plus you get to design you own studio! Best move I have made for my career.""

-Lindsey Bolton, Salon Apothecary

""After having worked in large upscale Salons and Managing Spas, I feel like the Sola Salon STUDIO is tailored for a more personal experience, a place where I can  have my clients know they are the focus and I am going to give them the time and attention they expect when having services performed. I also get the opportunity to express my own personal style in the studio decor and musical choices I want. This is my second Sola experience, having relocated from San Diego where I was in a Sola Salon Studio, to Boise, Idaho, I was thrilled to find the opportunity to be a Salon owner at Sola.in downtown Boise."" 

-Paula, Studio Bella Blu

""After being is the cosmetology profession for 14 years. I was tired of my artistic vision and business sensibilities having boundaries. When the opportunity to be a part of Sola Salons came up, it seemed like a great idea. Being my own owner with my own space, to be able to sell my clients the take home products they need and to offer a one on one private experience. I wasn't wrong. And in fact it has exceeded my expectations. My guests love my space, and everyone is so impressed with the concept. I could not be happier."" 

-Melissa, Muah
 
 
""I was enamored with the Sola concept a year before I made the decision to leap back into the self-employed world. I moved from a corporate setting with the sole desire to increase my clients guest experience and yes, that has happened and so have many more benefits than I anticipated. My clients enjoy the private space and the increase of one on one attention. My first time realizing that was after I had completed a loyal client's color (same formula, same styling products, same everything), she gasped at the final look and said, ""My hair has never looked better!"" From that day on, I knew I had made the right choice! As for the rest, Sola was such an easy transition and creates such a wonderful working environment. I love being in control of my time, choosing product lines tailored to my clients, and having the power to make the decisions that effect MY business."" 

Jamie, Bang Hair Studio

""I have been in the business for about 10 years.  I have worked in commission salons and lease salons. I was super excited to open my own salon with a great friends. We share a double studio. It was a big step for me, but the management at Sola made it very easy.  I am loving my experience there so far and have had great feed back from my clients!"" 
-Cherie Williamson, Salon Apothecary

""I must admit, I was a little apprehensive about moving my business to Sola. I was used to working in a salon with many other stylists and people around all of the time. Boy I'm glad I did! This place is awesome!!! Im in a double studio with my friend Jen, who I've worked with for 10 years. We decorated to our tastes, we listen to our favorite music and we carry our own retail.  My guests are almost more excited to be here. Almost.  The other studio owners are incredibly nice and I haven't noticed any drama. From day one I knew this was the place for me. ""
