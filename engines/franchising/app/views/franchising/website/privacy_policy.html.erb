                            <p>Last revised and Effective February 1, 2017</p>
                            <p>Sola Franchise Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Sola Salon Studios Canada,
                              Inc. (“Sola”), the proud owner of the Sola Salon Studios® brand, knows that your privacy
                              is important. This Privacy Policy sets out our privacy practices that apply when you use
                              any website, mobile application or other online service or platform of Sola or any other
                              Sola company that links or refers to it (collectively, the “Services”), regardless of who
                              owns or operates the Services, as well as our interactions with you on third party
                              platforms (such as social media).</p>
                            <p>1. Information We Collect</p>
                            <p>We collect personal information about our users in various ways. For example, we collect
                              information that you provide to us, information that we collect through your use of the
                              Services, and information that we collect from publicly available sources or third
                              parties.</p>
                            <p>Information You Provide to Us. We collect information you give us when you use the
                              Services. For example, when you visit one of our websites or use one of our Services,
                              create an account with us, participate in a survey or promotion, or take advantage of our
                              in-salon Wi-Fi service, we may ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, year
                              of birth, gender, street address, or mobile phone number so that we can provide Services

                              and expiration date, to process a financial transaction you have requested. We also may
                              collect information about the products you buy, including where and how frequently you buy

                              interests and better serve you.</p>
                            <p>Information About Your Use of the Services. In addition to the information you provide to
                              us directly, we may collect information about your use of the Services. For example, we
                              may collect:</p>

                              identifiers, operating system version, and settings of the device you use to access the

                              information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about
                              you from a social media site if you connect to the Services through that site.</p>

                            <p>Consent. We may otherwise use your information with your consent or at your

                            <p>3. Sharing of Information</p>
                            <p>The following provides information about entities with which we may share information.
                              Our practices vary depending on the type of information and sharing.</p>
                            <p>Affiliates. We may share information within our family of affiliated companies so that we
                              may provide offers from those companies that may be relevant to you, better understand
                              your preferences, and improve our Services.</p>
                            <p>Franchisees. We may share information with franchisees. We also may provide our
                              franchisees with information so that they may provide you with information, offers and

                            <p>Business Partners. We may also share your information with business partners to provide
                              you with Services that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion that runs
                              on our Services but that is offered, sponsored or co-sponsored by another company, your
                              information may be shared with that company. We are not responsible for the privacy
                              practices of these entities and recommend you review their privacy policies carefully.</p>
                            <p>Service Providers. We may share information with companies providing services on our

                              including your payment information, as appropriate to process your payments for the
                              Services or complete a transaction.</p>
                            <p>Social Media Services. If you connect a social media account with the Services or engage
                              with our services through a social media platform, we may share your information with that

                              information to personalize your experience on the Services and on the third-party social
                              media platforms, or to provide you with offers or other products or Services you may
                              request. The social media services’ use of the shared information will be governed by the
                              social media services’ privacy policy and your social media account settings.</p>

                              of the Services, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies,
                              and this information may be combined with information collected across different websites
                              and online services in order to deliver ads that are more relevant to you, both on and off
                              our Services.</p>
                            <p>Other Parties When Required or Permitted by Law, or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and
                              Services.We and our service providers (including affiliates) may use and share your
                              personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or
                              defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or
                              agents or users, to detect, suppress or prevent fraud or where otherwise required or
                              permitted by applicable law or legal process, including responding to a search warrant or
                              other legally valid requests from public and government authorities (which may include
                              lawful access by U.S., Canadian, or other governmental authorities, courts or law
                              enforcement agencies).</p>
                            <p>Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction. We reserve the right to
                              transfer any information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a
                              portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger,
                              acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.</p>
                            <p>Otherwise With Your Consent or at Your Direction. In addition to the sharing described in
                              this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you
                              consent to or direct such sharing.</p>
                            <p>Aggregated Data. We also may provide aggregated information, and data with personal
                              identifiers removed, to third parties to describe how our customers are using the
                              Services.</p>
                            <p>4. Online Advertising and Cookies</p>
                            <p>We and other companies that provide advertising and other services on our Services may
                              use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and
                              navigation, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and improve the
                              advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online
                              experience.</p>
                            <p>Interest-Based Advertisements. We may use third parties to serve advertisements on our
                              Services and on other websites and digital platforms. These companies may use cookies, web
                              beacons or other technologies to report certain information about your visits to our
                              Services and other websites (such as web pages you visit and your response to ads) in
                              order to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and to deliver ads that are
                              more relevant to you, both on and off our Services. To learn more and to opt-out of having
                              your information used by these companies for online behavioral advertising purposes,
                              please see “Choices with Respect to Interest-Based Advertisements” below. We may also use
                              services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads
                              to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your
                              email address or other information to the platform provider.</p>
                            <p>Cookies. “Cookies” are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a
                              website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer
                              or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing
                              sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For
                              example:</p>
                            <p>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those
                              credentials each time you visit a Service</p>
                            <p>Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most
                              popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much
                              time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to
                              adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.</p>
                            <p>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t
                              receive the same ad each time you access a Service.</p>
                            <p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so. If you
                              wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies.
                              If you disable cookies, it may interfere with the functioning of the Services.</p>
                            <p>Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or
                              “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be
                              embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain
                              types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a
                              particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and
                              the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes,
                              including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide
                              content and ads that are more relevant to you both on and off the Service.</p>
                            <p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit
                              “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of
                              differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always
                              clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are
                              aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if
                              anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not
                              take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and
                              accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>
                            <p>5. Privacy and Access Choices Available To You</p>
                            <p>Choices With Respect To Cookies and Similar Technologies. You may block cookies and
                              similar technologies in your browser or device settings, as and if permitted by such
                              device.</p>

                            <p>Data Access. Subject to applicable law, you may also have a right to access, update, and
                              correct inaccuracies in other personal information in our custody and control, subject to
                              certain exceptions prescribed by law. You may request access, updating and corrections of

                              writing to us at the contact information set out below. We may request certain personal
                              information for the purposes of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access to
                              their personal information records.</p>
                            <p>Email Promotions. You may opt out of receiving commercial email, text message, and other
                              electronic messages from us by following the instructions contained in those messages.</p>
                            <p>6. Data Security</p>
                            <p>We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect personal
                              information in our custody and control against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use,
                              modification and disclosure. However, as effective as these measures are, no security
                              system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our Services, nor can we
                              guarantee that the information you provide will not be intercepted while being transmitted
                              to us over the Internet.</p>

                              under the age of 13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a
                              child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in
                              accordance with applicable law.</p>
                            <p>Links to Third-Party Sites. Our Services may link to third-party websites and services
                              that we do not operate and are outside of our control. We are not responsible for the
                              security or privacy of any information collected by other websites or other services.
                              Please exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party
                              websites and services you use.</p>

                              changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on
                              the Services. Your use of the Services or your provision of personal information to use
                              the Services following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy
                              Policy.</p>
